# The Basics

## Programs
* C++ is a compiled language.
* Its source text get processed by a **compiler**, producing **object files** which are combined by a **linker** yielding an **executable program**.
* The source code files are called **source files**
* The executable program is not portable (Windows to Mac), but the source code is.

#### ISO C++ defined entities
* *Core language features*: built-in types and loops
* *Standard-library components*: containers and I/O operations


C++ is a *statically typed langauge*. Meaning the type of every entity must be known to the compiler at its point to use.
